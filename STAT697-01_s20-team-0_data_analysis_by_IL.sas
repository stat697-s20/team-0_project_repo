/*
Question 1 of 3: What are the top five schools that experienced the biggest
increase in "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" between AY2014-15 and AY2015-16?

Rationale: This should help identify schools to consider for new outreach based
upon increasing child-poverty levels.

Note: This compares the column "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" from frpm1415
to the column of the same name from frpm1516.

/*
Question 2 of 3: Can "Percent (%) Eligible FRPM (K-12)" be used to predict the
proportion of high school graduates earning a combined score of at least 1500
on the SAT?

Rationale: This would help inform whether child-poverty levels are associated
with college-preparedness rates, providing a strong indicator for the types of
schools most in need of college-preparation outreach.

Note: This compares the column "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" from frpm1415
to the column PCTGE1500 from sat15.

/*
Question 3 of 3: What are the top ten schools were the number of high school graduates
taking the SAT exceeds the number of high school graduates completing UC/CSU
entrance requirements?

Rationale: This would help identify schools with significant gaps in
preparation specific for California's two public university systems, suggesting
where focused outreach on UC/CSU college-preparation might have the greatest
impact.

Note: This compares the column NUMTSTTAKR from sat15 to the column TOTAL from
gradaf15.
